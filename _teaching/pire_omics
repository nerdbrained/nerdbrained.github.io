With other members of the Philippines PIRE group, I co-taught a workshop on using UNIX command-line pipelines to process and analyze next-generation sequencing data. Students learned quality control for Illumina sequencing data, genome assembly and annotation, mapping data to a reference genome, and basic population structure and demographic inferences, as well as how to use GitHub and RStudio.

Class materials can be found on the workshop's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/philippinespire/2022_PIRE_omics_workshop)
