My PhD research project used genetic data from multiple turtle species in the Midwestern US to examine how landscape changes have impacted genetic diversity and connectivity. I am currently expanding this research to create a rangewide genomic database for the endangered Blanding's turtle that will help us identify management units as well as identify populations of origin for poached turtles.
