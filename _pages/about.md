Hello! I'm a scientist researching ecology and evolutionary biology with applications to conservation of biodiversity.

I work mainly on reptiles, amphibians, and fish, and I also use museum specimens extensively in my research.

I will be starting a faculty position at the [Université de Namur](https://unamur.be/fr) in Belgium in Fall of 2025 and will be looking for a TA/PhD student in the fall. Feel free to contact me if you are interested!
