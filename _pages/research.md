My research combines cutting-edge genome sequencing over space and time with habitat data, demographic data, and computational methods in order to understand species’ and communities’ evolutionary responses to environmental change over time and to inform conservation solutions to ensure their persistence. I am particularly interested in using museum collections to understand the underpinnings of species’ responses to novel stresses and to preserve biodiversity in the current era of global change. These research interests have led me to focus on three parallel research themes aimed at both testing evolutionary theory and finding practical applications of theory to address conservation problems.
